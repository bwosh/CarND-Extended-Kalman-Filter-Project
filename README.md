# Extended Kalman Filter Project


This project is a part of:  
 [![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)  
 and it's basing on [CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project ](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project) github repository.

## Description

This project utilizes a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with:
 * noisy lidar measurements 
 * noisy radar measurements. 

This project involves the [Term 2 Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).
